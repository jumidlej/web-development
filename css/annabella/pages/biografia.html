					There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum 
					available, but the majority have suffered alteration 
					in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words 
					which don't look even slightly believable. If you are 
					going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be 
					sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the 
					middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the 
					Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, 
					making this the first true generator on the Internet. 
					It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined 
					with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate 
					Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem 
					Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected 
					humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
